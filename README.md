# markit

Yet another markdown editor. 
Little bit of fun experimenting with node-webkit and angularjs

## Setup
```
npm install
bower install
```

## Gulpin'
```
gulp
gulp watch
gulp build-osx
```

To run `build-osx` you need to create a folder named `dist` in the root directory, with a copy of the webkit binary renamed to `markit.app` inside it.
